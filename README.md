### 👩‍💻 About Me

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my **MS in Business Analytics** at UC Davis, blending my love for numbers, logic, and impact-driven work.

💼 Former **Data Operations Analyst at Consilio**, where I worked on legal data workflows and process optimization.

📊 Passionate about making data accessible, actionable, and responsible—whether it's through dashboards, ML models, or insightful narratives.

🧠 Especially interested in **mental health**, **AI for good**, and **data in healthcare**. Built a medical chatbot for a StartUp using **PrimeKG** and **MedReason** as part of an ongoing internship.

🧩 Side obsession: puzzles (Wordle, Queens, Rubik's Cube) and quirky paradoxes. I like finding clarity in chaos.
